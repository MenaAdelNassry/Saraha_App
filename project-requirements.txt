Project Requirements Specification: Saraha Clone (Backend Only)
1. Functional Requirements
A. Authentication & User Management

Sign Up: Users must be able to register using email and password.

Email Verification: System must send a verification link/code to validate the user's email address upon registration to prevent fake accounts.

Login: Secure login mechanism using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

Profile Management: Users can update their display name, bio, and upload an avatar.

Password Recovery: Flow to reset forgotten passwords via email.

B. Messaging System

Anonymous Messaging: Public users (unregistered or logged out) can send text-based messages to registered users using their unique profile link/ID.

Inbox Retrieval: Registered users can retrieve a paginated list of received messages.

Message Details: Users can view the timestamp and content of individual messages.

Delete Message: Users can permanently delete received messages.

Reply Capability (Optional V2): Users can reply to messages (replies visible to the sender if they provided a contact method, or public on profile).

2. Non-Functional Requirements (Quality Attributes)
A. Security

Input Sanitization: Strict validation and sanitization of all incoming text (especially anonymous messages) to prevent XSS and Injection attacks.

Rate Limiting: Implement strict rate limiting on the "Send Message" endpoint to prevent spamming and DDoS attacks.

Data Protection: Passwords must be hashed (e.g., using bcrypt/Argon2) before storage.

B. Performance & Scalability

Pagination: All list endpoints (e.g., Get Messages) must implement Cursor-based or Offset-based pagination.

Stateless Architecture: The API should be stateless to allow for horizontal scaling in the future.

C. Technology Stack

Language: TypeScript

Runtime: Node.js

Framework: Express.js

Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)
